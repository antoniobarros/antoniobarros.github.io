Introduction to statistical methods for clinical and epidemiological research, including:

- Descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
- Regression analysis (linear, logistic)
- Survival analysis fundamentals

### Machine Learning in Healthcare
**PhD Programme** | FMUP

Advanced course covering:

- Supervised learning methods for clinical prediction
- Model validation and calibration
- High-dimensional data analysis
- Practical applications with R

### Applied Data Science in Medicine
**Postgraduate Course** | FMUP

Hands-on workshop series on:

- R programming for medical research

## Pedagogical Philosophy

My teaching philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Integration of theory and practice** — Every statistical concept is illustrated with real medical examples
2. **Reproducibility** — All analyses are conducted in R with documented, shareable code
3. **Critical thinking** — Students learn to question assumptions and interpret results in context
4. **The evolving role of researchers** — Preparing students for an AI-augmented research landscape
