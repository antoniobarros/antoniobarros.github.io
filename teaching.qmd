## Pedagogical Philosophy

My teaching philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Integration of theory and practice** — Every statistical concept is illustrated with real medical examples
2. **Reproducibility** — All analyses are conducted in R/Python with documented code
3. **Critical thinking** — Students learn to question assumptions and interpret results in context
4. **The evolving role of researchers** — Preparing students for an AI-augmented research landscape
