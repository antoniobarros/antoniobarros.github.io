My research focuses on developing and applying advanced statistical and machine learning methods to cardiovascular medicine. I work at the intersection of biostatistics, clinical epidemiology, and data science.

## Current Projects

### CardioNIR
**FCT-funded project** investigating near-infrared spectroscopy applications in cardiac surgery. This project explores novel biomarker detection methods for perioperative risk assessment.

### Cardio-Oncology Cohort Studies
Collaboration with breast cancer survivor cohorts to assess long-term cardiovascular risk following cancer treatment. This work integrates clinical data with multi-modal biomarkers.

### Cardiovascular AI Infrastructure
Development of automated extraction pipelines for clinical data and multi-modal biomarker analysis. Grant proposals in preparation for EU4Health programme applications.
